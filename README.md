This is a template repository.
<br><sub>A github 'repo' is one of the better ways to contribute and work collaboratively with others.</sub>

#### When publishing this repo you'll need to do a few things:
<hr>

#### Decide on a name for your Add-On, you should avoid trademarks whenever possible. This `ADDON_NAME` that you decide will be used several times throughout the mod.

<hr>

## Directory:
- Change `Contents/mods/main` to `Contents/mods/ADDON_NAME`
<br><sub>Specifically, rename `main` to `ADDON_NAME`</sub>

<hr>

## Artwork:
Modify both files as needed:
- `Contents/mods/main/poster.png`
- `preview.png`
<br><sub>You should avoid using clear and visible trademarks where possible. While this would technically fall under fair-use, the companies that own these games are within their rights to challenge it. Include the provided `unofficialFanContent_watermark` in your artwork if you're concerned/extra-cautious.</sub>

<hr>

## In `workshop.txt`:
- Change `ADDON_NAME` to what you'd like to name your add-on. <br><sub>Becareful in using trademarked words on public facing webpages like the workshop page.<br>Even with credit given later on, the use of the trademark is not permissible in titles in many cases.</sub>
<br>
<br>
- These are selfexplanatory: `DESCRIBE_YOUR_ADD_ON_HERE` and `DESCRIBE_ADD_ONS_FEATURES_IN_MORE_DETAIL` to their self-described game. <br><br>For example: "Game Night: Occult" has:
  - `Includes occult and supernatural items to play with.`
  - `Get a glimpse of what the future... or the past... has in store for you...`
  <br><sub>Again, be careful not to use trademarked slogans.</sub>
<br>
<br>
- In the credits section, change `GAME_TITLE` to the add-on's official name, as well as `GAME_COMPANY` to the rightful owner of the IP/trademark/copyright. This is the only case where using their name/trademark is acceptable.
<br>
<br>
 - Change the TWO instances of `AUTHOR` to your Steam username. <br><sub>While the disclaimer uses your current steam name - this is the disclaimer Steam recommends using.<br>It should be noted that your past usernames are listed in your profile.</sub><br><sub>You will get people making jokes about making their username yours to repost it; they're dumb.</sub>
<hr>

## In `mod/info`:

<hr>

```
name=Game Night - ADDON_NAME
id=gamenight_ADDON_NAME
```
- Change `ADDON_NAME` to the same thing as the workshop.txt's.
- Optional: add a description line - from wrokshop.txt:`DESCRIBE_YOUR_ADD_ON_HERE`
